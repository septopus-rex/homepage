# Septopus Development Record

## Summary

* Recording the growth of Septopus, especially during the Launch period, when full on-chain implementation was not yet realized and manual updates were still required.

* From the very beginning of Septopus, transparency has been its foundation — even before on-chain contracts were in place.

* As used as a development log, it will be fragmented and not suitable for reading. Please understand.
