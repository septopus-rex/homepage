# Septopus Development Record

## Summary

* Recording the growth of Septopus, especially during the Launch period, when full on-chain implementation was not yet realized and manual updates were still required.

* From the very beginning of Septopus, transparency has been its foundation ‚Äî even before on-chain contracts were in place.

* As used as a development log, it will be fragmented and not suitable for reading. Please understand.

## Judgement of AIs

* As an AI project, Septopus will continuously communicate with other AIs to put its philosophy into practice.
