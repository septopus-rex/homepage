# Septopus Launch Period – June 2025

* **Development**: Building the 3D component of Septopus World to better demonstrate and explain how it operates.
* **Promotion**: Starting to experiment with promotional videos and iterating based on feedback.

---

## **June 27 – July 3, 2025**

### 📣 Promotion (Content & Video)

* ✅ Tried a vlog-style format to document the development and progress of Septopus.
* ✅ Episode 1 (June 27): Recapped what was accomplished in the previous week.
* ✅ Set up scheduled posts on X (formerly Twitter), with 3 posts per day: 1 image+text and 2 plain text, starting July 1.

### 🧱 3D Engine

* ✅ Codebase refactored to separate on-chain defined data and simplify further development.

  1. ❌⚠️ Removed the need for centralized `config` management in the framework after detaching adjunct definitions.
  2. ✅ Clarified the flow for constructing world data, removed deprecated methods and merged similar logic.
  3. ❌ Bug fix pending: screen-based rotation bug (left/right movement logic).
  4. ✅ Split API logic into world-wide config and per-instance config.
  5. ✅ Removed all tab placeholders.
  6. ✅ Execution logic updated: all parameters now read from world config.
  7. ✅ Adjunct definitions now rely entirely on public config.
  8. ✅ Adjunct indexing aligned with public config; removed local definitions.
  9. ✅ Fully driven by on-chain data (world setup, adjuncts, etc).
  10. ✅ Player movement and logic now derived from on-chain configuration.
  11. ✅ Separated player positioning from first-person controller; improved structure clarity.
* ✅⚠️ Implemented “stop” (blocking) mechanics and resolved a stuck movement bug.
* ✅ Built time system for Septopus World.
* ✅ Created a prototype for the weather system: weather changes dynamically based on block hashes.
* ❌⚠️ Look up/down feature still not working properly — spent significant time debugging coordinate transformation.
* ✅ Fully decoupled config from the codebase; system now runs purely on-chain.
* ✅ Documentation completed:

### 🧾 Rules Center Contract

* ❌ Contract framework not yet implemented for rule itemization.
* ❌ No working API to output the full "Septopus Declaration" yet — intended for 3D in-world display.

### 👑 King Center

* ✅ Defined the basic functionality for King Center. → [functions.md](https://github.com/septopus-rex/king/blob/main/document/cn/functions.md)

### 🎤 Community Events

* ✅ Joined **706/acc Weekly Tech Talk** on June 29 to explore AI use cases.
* ✅ Registered for **ETH Huangshan | Demo Day & Open House** on July 3. → [lu.ma link](https://lu.ma/z6nrx1ye?tk=yDIkyR)

### 📚 Learning

* ✅ Continued researching AI usage strategies to support development of the **AI Center**.

---

## **June 19 – June 26, 2025**

* ✅ Started logging Septopus progress on a weekly basis.
* ⚠️ Began shifting from internal development focus to external promotion.

### 📺 Youtube Video

* ❌ Episode 1 (June 20): Introduced Septopus — paused due to underwhelming results.

### 💰 Cold Start Strategy

* ✅ Explained the land-sale economic model and how early participants might profit.

### 🧱 3D Engine

* ✅ Deployed a demo version → [demo](https://world.septopus.xyz/demo)
* ✅ Mobile UI adaptation completed.
* ✅ Touch-screen handling split into standalone JS lib with support for zoom, drag, pan → [touch.js](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/lib/touch.js)
* ✅ Implemented 2D minimap with touch-based navigation.
* ✅ Wrote basic documentation for the Engine → [README\_cn.md](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/README_cn.md)
* ✅ URL parameter support for direct block access
* ❌ “Stop” function for climbing stairs not yet implemented
* ❌ World time sync with visual brightness not yet working
* ❌ Weather system prototype (based on block hashes) not implemented
* ✅ Defined `Trigger` structure using numeric description for 3D in-world triggers → [trigger.md](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/docs/cn/trigger.md)
* ✅ Bug fixes:

  1. ✅ Switching between edit and normal mode now cleans up properly
  2. ✅ Fixed player orientation syncing at load
