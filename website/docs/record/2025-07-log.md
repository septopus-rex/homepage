## 2025.7.18～2025.7.24

### Promotion (Content and Video)

* ✅ Episode 4 (2025.7.19), vlog update covering last week’s progress. Not yet uploaded to YouTube.
* ✅ Purchased an important prop for “Cattle-Horse-Donkey Journey”: the donkey. Tested interaction with tourists at the viewing platform, including photo-charging experiment.

### 3D Engine Development

* ❌⚠️ Implementation of Player looking up and down; coordinate conversion is correct.

* ✅ Trigger functionality optimized — frame-synchronized animation and triggering.
  1. ✅ Unified animation handling in frame sync functions.
  2. ✅ System subsystem calls working.
  3. ✅ UI calls working.
  4. ✅ Adjunct calls working — adjunct methods can be used for animation.
  5. 🛑 Bag subsystem calls tested — Bag requires full redesign.

* ✅⚠️ **Game Mode** implementation; analyzing various scenarios. Security issues deferred until sample version ready.
  1. ❌ Centralized resource loading.
  2. ✅ Disabled dynamic loading.
  3. ✅ Game map implementation (config specifies area; 2D map can be drawn later).
  4. ✅ Game mode supports independent server requests. One version published: [mode.md](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/docs/cn/mode.md)

* ✅⚠️ Deployment of **Climb Stairs** game (mobile playable).
  1. ✅ Fixed 3D content, displayed ads using “Ad space for rent” image.
  2. ✅ Added lock time for fall and death.
  3. ✅ Bug fix — player height error caused stair climbing issues.
  4. ❌ Bug fix — fall detection when crossing blocks with height differences.

* ✅ Added countdown UI component for triggers.

* ✅ Module component refactoring — models can be imported correctly.
  1. ✅ Mocked resource file for 3D display.
  2. ✅ Parameter setting tested, scaling needs to be handled in resource files.
  3. ✅ Added FBX parsing to ThreeObject.
  4. ✅ Used events for asynchronous module parsing.

## 2025.7.11～2025.7.17

### Promotion (Content and Video)

* ✅ Episode 3 (2025.7.14), vlog update covering last week’s progress. Not yet uploaded to YouTube.

### 3D Engine Development

* ✅ Discussed trigger design with ChatGTP. Need to handle selection of system components and data modifications — quite complex.

* ✅ On-chain text resources implemented. Prepared for triggers — text can be stored in Accounts or IPFS, like resources/textures/modules.

* ✅⚠️ Trigger functioning correctly — conditions checked, control over adjuncts possible.
  1. ✅ Basic data structure designed, constants defined.
  2. ✅ Task data structure designed. Framework selects items and passes them to methods; TriggerBuild organizes workflow.
  3. ✅ TriggerBuilder tested and implemented. Workflow complete — from adjunct trigger to successful player activation.
  4. ✅ System component selection tested.
  5. ✅ Adjunct selection tested.
  6. ✅ Task system built to handle trigger operations.

* ✅ Implemented continuous player actions — instead of chaining animations, motion is locked after triggering and camera dynamically adjusted.
  1. ✅ Falling motion implemented.
  2. ✅ High-altitude fall death handled.

* ✅ Fixed player standing height bugs caused by block transitions.
  1. ✅⚠️ Adjusted standing height when crossing blocks with different elevations.
  2. ✅ Fall detection with block height differences.
  3. ✅ Stop stepping logic with elevation differences.
  4. ✅ Stop blocking logic with elevation differences.
  5. ✅ Stop stepping logic when crossing blocks with elevation differences.
  6. ✅ Stop blocking logic when crossing blocks with elevation differences.
  7. ✅ Fall detection when crossing stop with elevation differences.
  8. ✅ Fall detection on blocks with elevation differences.

* ❌⚠️ Implementation of Player looking up and down; coordinate conversion is correct.

* ✅⚠️ Developed **Climb Stairs** mini-game to test base systems.
  1. ✅⚠️ Stairs scene built; player can climb.
  2. ✅⚠️ Cross-block scene built.
  3. ❌⚠️ Reaching target platform should trigger success.
  4. ✅ Simulated billboard display.

* ✅⚠️ **Game Mode** initial implementation — adjunct behavior differs by mode.
  1. ✅ Tested Trigger activation in different modes.
  2. ❌ Pre-rendering implementation (preload specified areas).
  3. ✅ Disabled dynamic loading in Game Mode.

* ✅ Code cleanup — removed unnecessary globals, adjusted call positions.

  1. ✅ Adjusted player standing height.
  2. ✅ Switching between stops works correctly.
  3. ✅ Fall detection works.
  4. ✅ Cross-block blocking detection works.
  5. ❌ Cross-block stop standing issue — requires handling component switching.

  1. ✅ Missing block borders after Edit mode.
  2. ✅ Normal button malfunction fixed.
  3. ✅ Block altitude mismatch with 3D corrected.

  3. ✅ Player events implemented \["fall","death"].
  4. ✅ Trigger entry events work.
  5. ✅ Block events implemented \["loaded","in","out"].
  6. ✅ Trigger events implemented \["in","out","hold"].
  7. ✅ Stop events implemented \["on","beside"].
  8. ✅ Two trigger modes implemented: 1) system-level events; 2) 3D object triggers.

* ✅ Trigger functioning correctly — conditions checked, control over adjuncts possible.
  1. ✅ Basic data structure designed, constants defined.
  2. ❌ Task data structure design incomplete.
  3. ❌ TriggerBuilder incomplete.
