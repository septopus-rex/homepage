# Septopus, Your Rules, Your Worlds

## **Goal**

* To realize the decentralized world set forth in the [Septopus Declaration](https://septopus.xyz/declaration), the implementation is now structured into four primary **Projects**.

| Project Name | Objective | Implementation Plan | Timeline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Meta Septopus](/docs/world/overview) | Participant verification and primary hub for all activities | Virtual World | 2025.6.19 – 2025.12.19 |
| **Rules Center** | Establish a self-consistent system for decentralized online rules, beginning with the Declaration's governance framework | Solana Smart Contract Implementation |  |
| **King Management** | Implement all King functionalities, establish a unified management process, and set up unified fund distribution | Solana Smart Contract Implementation |  |
| **AI Management** | Establish the AI review mechanism and the process for AI judgment and audit of projects | - |  |

* **Meta Septopus** is a vital component, composed of multiple metaverses that are decentralized from issuance to management. **Meta Septopus** is the first **Project** realized from the [Septopus Declaration](https://septopus.xyz/declaration), serving as an experimental testbed for the complete governance workflow, including project creation, token issuance, token distribution, and revenue management.  
* The use of **AI for full-process management** is a major innovation of Septopus. AI's efficiency and impartiality will enable **Entrepreneurs** to deeply participate in the co-building of Septopus and secure funding. The **King** provides the final check, implementing the ultimate authority in the process. This makes the entire Septopus the most streamlined **Government System**—a governance system with only one person, who is randomly selected via a lottery. This represents the extreme limit of governmental streamlining in this era, and we invite you to help us create this intriguing structure.

## **Economic Model**

* Septopus establishes its economic system through **Projects**, utilizing **Tokens** as project returns, with the goal of building a self-sustaining financial ecosystem. Septopus will use **AI to evaluate and invest** the funds raised into various Projects. All Septopus **Participants** can periodically receive returns from Septopus's distributed profits, including existing digital assets and Tokens issued by Projects.  
* Septopus is an **open world**, where all **Participants** can submit **Projects** without discrimination to obtain investment, with the initiator receiving digital currency support. Both the proposal review and the fund distribution for a Project must pass **review by 7 AIs**, and then be submitted to the **King for final approval**.  
* The **Block** setting in Septopus includes an **Abandonment Mechanism**. A Block will enter an abandoned state, allowing other players to claim it for free, under two conditions: first, if the owner voluntarily relinquishes it; second, if the Block has not been updated in the Septopus World for over 100 years.

## **Fundraising**

* Septopus does not restrict fundraising methods, currently primarily including the following:

| Method | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Donations** | Accepting donations of digital assets | Link for donations |
| **Token Issuance** | Septopus issuing its own native Token | ERC20, SPL Token |
| **Project Tokens** | Tokens issued by Projects invested in by Septopus | Meta Septopus |
