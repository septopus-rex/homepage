# UI

* Code location: [/io/io_ui.js](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/io/io_ui.js)
  
* The UI provides interactive functions beyond the 3D environment, such as information, location, etc., and also provides support for extending the functionality of the Septopus Engine.
  
* The UI supports rewriting, which means that all components can be replaced, so that the front-end UI can be completely customized.

## Methods

* A unified calling method is used to use UI components, `VBW.ui.show(type,ctx,cfg)`. The list of available components is as follows:

| Name | Function | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
|toast| Display of prompt information | Output system prompt information and other functions |
|dailog| Pop-up dialog box | Interaction of large amounts of complex information, such as the display of 2D maps, etc. |
|compass| Just compass | Displays the player's location information |
|sidebar| Sidebar | In edit mode, multiple editing options are displayed |
|form| Form | Multiple inputs in edit mode |
|fold| Collapse Menu | Optimize UI experience and fold function menu |
|menu| Button list menu | Main function menu implementation |
|pop| Pop-up menu | List of operation functions of different adjuncts in edit mode |
|mode| Mode switch button | Switching game modes and viewing game configurations |
|countdown| Countdown component | Player death recovery countdown |
|status| Status display button | Block information display |

* By combining basic UIs, more display structures can be implemented, such as page implementation.
