# Renderer

* The `renderer` runs in `world coordinates (B coordinate system)`, which uses `plot positioning` on `standard data (std)` to piece together the complete world.

## Types of Renderer

* According to system requirements, the Septopus Engine supports three types of renderers, whose main functions are as follows:

|  Type   | Main Function | Code  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
|  3D Renderer  | ä¸»The main renderer displays the 3D scene of the Septopus world  | `/render/render_3d.js`  |
|  2D Renderer | 2D map renderer, showing a small map  | `/render/render_2d.js`  |
|  Observe Renderer  | Display models generated by other 3D software or single block  | `/render/render_observe.js`  |

## Program Structure

* Use the unified rendering entry `RENDERER.show()`, which can be called directly by the framework.

* `Renderer` needs to build the running Dom structure. For example, 2D needs to create `<canvas></canvas>` for drawing.

*`renderer` can parse `standard data (std)` to generate `rendering data`, or use data that has been parsed by other renderers for output.
