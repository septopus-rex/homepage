# Solana Contract

* Github: [https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/tree/main/chain](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/tree/main/chain)
* `Solana` is a high-speed blockchain network that is uniquely suited to running Septopus.
* Using a single contract entry to realize the vision of `Septopus` facilitates dissemination and reduces the possibility of fraud.

## Contract Constructure

* The contract adopts the structure of [Solana CPI](https://solana.com/docs/core/cpi) to maintain a consistent external interface.
* The adoption of CPI also supports Kingâ€™s sign-off on all audits.
