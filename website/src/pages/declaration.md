# Septopus Declaration

## **Preface: The Awakening of Ideals**

The development of technology, particularly artificial intelligence and blockchain, now enables the creation of a fair and transparent system to address the corruption and injustice inherent in outdated power structures.

Septopus, an autonomous world jointly driven by humans, AI, and blockchain, aims to build a new model of governance based on fairness and justice. Here, there is no decayed authority, no entrenched hierarchy, and no theatrical governance—every participant can build their own career and social network within this on-chain virtual world.

## **Governance Structure**

1. Septopus consists of all on-chain participants. Anyone can freely join or leave, regardless of region, ethnicity, or gender.
2. Septopus designates the King as the sole fixed member, who must remain anonymous.
3. Legislative power belongs to all participants and is conducted through open discussions. Except for **broad consensus**, new laws require the King's signature.
4. Judicial power is vested in AI, with Cases submitted publicly and reviewed by AI. Outcomes require the King's signature.
5. Executive power is also vested in AI. Projects are publicly proposed and reviewed by AI. Outcomes require the King's signature.
6. All Septopus affairs and financial operations—including legislation, justice, and administration—are managed via Projects.
7. Septopus profits will be distributed fairly to all participants.
8. Septopus adheres to principles of openness: non-on-chain individuals may also view all materials.
9. Newcomers to Septopus will enjoy equal rights and opportunities as earlier participants.
10. Septopus does not define a termination rule; when it can no longer operate financially, it will dissolve naturally.

### **Participant Rules**

1. Participants must be confirmed through a clear and public on-chain method, with participation time and activity logged.
2. Participants may freely join or leave, provided they do not interfere with others.
3. Due to its virtual nature, shadow accounts are inevitable. A dedicated organization will be established for oversight.
4. Participants may be expelled (blacklisted) if they:
   a. Refuse to execute decisions;
   b. Fail in initiating an impeachment;
   c. Are confirmed to be shadow accounts.
5. Participants may voluntarily leave by canceling their on-chain identity.

### **Rule System**

1. Rule changes must be proposed by a challenger, discussed publicly for 4 weeks, and then voted on.
2. All participants may vote by paying a small fee. A 50% turnout is required. If passed, the proposal is signed by the King and the fee is refunded. If failed, the fee goes to the treasury.
3. Proposals with >80% turnout and approval are deemed **broad consensus** and do not require the King's signature.
4. If a new rule is passed, all voting fees are rewarded to the challenger.
5. New rules enter into force after a 2-week buffer period, after which AI will apply them to projects and proposals.
6. Any participant may file a Case regarding rule violations and receive a reward if the Case is upheld.

### **King Rules**

1. The King holds broad veto power over all resolutions requiring a signature.
2. The King's term is limited to 2 years and is selected via lottery.
3. Eligible participants (existing for ≥2 weeks) may join the selection pool for 2 weeks.
4. The selected King must confirm within 1 week and create required social accounts. Upon confirmation, funding begins.
5. If the King does not confirm in time, a new one is selected immediately from the same pool.
6. The King must regularly check in. Signing resolutions counts as a check-in.
7. The King will store a secret file on-chain. If the secret is decrypted, the King's anonymity is considered compromised.
8. The King receives weekly free funding of at least 2 BTC and 1% of Septopus annual profit, with full discretionary use.
9. Upon completion of term, the King continues receiving 5 weeks of funding with secondary withdrawal priority.
10. A new King is selected 4 weeks before the current term ends, allowing for a smooth transition.
11. A new King will also be selected if:
    a. No check-in or signing for 2 weeks;
    b. Two-year term is completed;
    c. King resigns (by revealing the secret key);
    d. Anonymity is compromised;
    e. King is impeached;
    f. King initiates rule-making.
12. The King may be impeached. Any participant with ≥2 weeks of activity may initiate, and only one impeachment may proceed at a time.
13. Impeachment has two stages: activation (≥15% turnout, ≥60% support) and final vote (≥40% turnout, ≥66.7% support).
14. Voting requires a small fee. If successful, fees are rewarded to the challenger.
15. If unsuccessful, a 2-week cooldown is triggered to prevent repeated malicious attempts.
16. Septopus accepts the governance vacuum in the event of King absence.

### **Project Rules**

1. Projects are the primary way Septopus handles expenses and earns revenue.
2. Projects are governed by 7 independent AIs to eliminate human corruption.
3. All proposals and AI assessments are recorded on-chain and are publicly accessible.
4. Any participant may submit a Project, paying a small fee for AI evaluation.
5. A majority of AIs (≥5 of 7) must approve the Project. Each proposal may be submitted up to 3 times.
6. Approved Projects are publicized for 2 weeks for review and feedback. Then the King signs.
7. Once signed, if funding is involved, automatic execution begins per the proposal.
8. Project results are audited by AI, followed by 2 weeks of public review, then final signature and payment.
9. AI recruitment is public and occurs annually. Candidates must deploy 3 months in advance.
10. AI management is treated as Projects and may charge fees. One entity may operate only one AI; duplicates will be disqualified.
11. If fewer than 5 AIs remain, AI operations pause while replacements are recruited.

## **Launch Period**

1. Septopus begins with a 2-year Launch Period starting June 19, 2025.
2. During this period, no new Rules can be created or amended; only this declaration is valid.
3. The Founder, as whitepaper author, acts as interim King. If decentralization fails, the project ends or continues under new leadership.
4. Funding is raised to build core systems and promote Septopus.
5. Four initial Projects are launched to support basic decentralized functions:
   a. **Rules Center**: Open forum for discussion, law compatibility checks;
   b. **Septopus World**: Identity/authentication system, anonymity tools, funding sources;
   c. **King Center**: Lottery selection, declaration, check-in, impeachment, and funding mechanisms;
   d. **AI Center**: Selection, bidding, deployment of decision-making AIs.
6. These Projects will define Septopus' operational framework.
7. All fundraising and spending are recorded on-chain for full transparency.
8. The Founder may end the Launch Period early based on system readiness.
9. At the end of this phase, the first King is selected.
