## 2025.8.22–2025.8.28

### Promotion

* ✅ Prepared to release **V1.0.0** for user testing, explaining what Septopus is building.
* ✅ Feature documentation for **V1.0.0**. Link: [https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/docs/release/ver\_1.0.0.md](https://github.com/septopus-rex/world/blob/main/engine/src/septopus/docs/release/ver_1.0.0.md)

### 3D Engine

* ✅ Implemented 2D map functionality.
  1. ✅ Scale calculations are correct.
  2. ❌⚠️ Add detail rendering to show block details.
  3. ✅ Added more info output to Dialog.
  4. ✅ Added reset button in Dialog to return to initial state.
  5. ✅ Update logic adjusted — refresh only after player movement.

* ✅ Bug fixes and legacy issue handling.
  1. ✅⚠️ Bug when crossing blocks with height difference — fall calculation incorrect, need to fix player’s view height.
  2. ✅ Separated IO operations, added Pages for later extension.
  3. ✅ Fixed missing Player state update when crossing blocks with zero height difference.
  4. ✅ Fixed Module not showing after block reload.
  5. ✅ Corrected timing of System’s launch event trigger.
  6. ✅ Added Player info page to view user data.
  7. ✅ Adjusted Player initial standing height based on block.

* ✅ Display optimization.
  1. ✅ Added shadow support and tested effect — issues remain, requires full setup.
  2. ❌ Added lighting support and tested display effect.
  3. ✅ Added `state.js` to monitor performance changes.
  4. ✅ Performance test by extending player’s field — lags when set to 5, framerate cannot sustain 60.
  5. ✅ UI optimization — collapsible menu, adjusted color tone.

* ✅ Trigger lifecycle optimization.
  1. ❌ Implement `abord` function structure — logic set up, need to call `abord` method.
  2. ❌ Implement `recover` function structure — logic set up, need to call `recover` method.
  3. ❌ Refactor logic to find suitable execution points.
  4. ✅ Game mode loads correctly based on parameters.
  5. ✅ Added teleport function to transfer/set player’s starting position.
  6. ✅ Prepared Game mode entry button — UI optimized for easier access.

## 2025.8.15–2025.8.21

### Promotion (Content & Video)

* ❌ Vlog Episode 6 (2025.8.21) to review prior work — not uploaded to YouTube yet.

* ❌ Upload Septopus vlog videos for browsing on the homepage.
* ✅ Updated July records on the website, embedding YouTube videos into Markdown files.

### 3D Engine

* ✅ Implemented Player look up/down functionality, coordinate transformation works.

* ✅ Code optimization for performance and execution logic.
  1. ✅ Fixed module loading logic to prevent duplicate loads causing performance issues.
  2. ✅ Improved block reload execution logic to reduce refreshes and duplicate data requests.
  3. ✅ Added code comments to key components for easier later development.

* ✅ Game mode advanced development.
  1. ❌🛑 Implement region loading with parameter restrictions.
  2. ❌🛑 2D map draws normally, but only within game region.
  3. ✅ Simulated game config data, triggers Game mode when entering block.
  4. ✅ Game logic executes from on-chain config, interacting with game server.
  5. ✅ Game mode UI implemented — after confirming on-chain data, button appears to enter game.

* ✅ Bug fixes and legacy issue handling.
  1. ❌ Fall calculation bug when crossing blocks with height differences.
  2. ✅ Fixed 2D map mouse panning issue.
  3. ✅ Implemented zoom control on 2D map’s right side.
  4. ✅ Zoom ratio displays correctly on 2D map.
  5. ✅ Synced player position with 2D map — cleared frame sync function after exit to avoid errors.
  6. ✅ Unified block loading methods: removed `VBW.prepair`, kept only `VBW.load`.
